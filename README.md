## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üîê Secure Multi-User Authentication**: Built-in sign-up and login system to protect your agent. User credentials are securely hashed and stored in a local JSON file.
*   **üë§ Isolated User Sessions**: Each logged-in user gets their own independent agent instance. Chat history, browser state, and running tasks are completely separate from other users.
*   **‚ö° Parallel Task Execution**: The server is configured to handle multiple user requests concurrently, allowing several agents to run tasks at the same time without blocking each other.
*   **üé® Sleek Custom Interface**: A modern, custom-themed dark mode UI that is clean, responsive, and user-friendly.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Comprehensive Configuration**: Easily configure agent and browser settings through the UI, including:
    *   LLM provider, model, and temperature.
    *   Headless mode and browser window size.
    *   Paths for saving agent history, recordings, and downloads.
*   **üöÄ Developer Friendly**: Integrated auto-reloading for rapid development. Just save a file, and the server restarts with your changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Python
*   **Web Framework**: Gradio
*   **Auto-Reload Server**: Uvicorn
*   **Environment Management**: `python-dotenv`

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Git

### 2. Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
3. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
On Windows:
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages from the requirements.txt file. If you do not have one, you can create it by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing the packages below.
pip install gradio uvicorn python-dotenv
# Add any other specific libraries your project needs, e.g.:
# pip install langchain-google-genai browser-use ...

Or, if a requirements.txt is provided:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Environment Setup
The application uses a .env file to manage secret keys and configurations.
Create a file named .env in the root of the project and add your API keys. Use the example below as a template:
.env file:

# Example for Google Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"

# Example for OpenAI
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

# VNC password if you are using the browser view
VNC_PASSWORD="yourvncpword"

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Application
You can run the server in two modes:
1. Standard Mode
This is the standard way to run the application.


python webui.py


Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:7788.
Signing Up a New User
The application has a built-in sign-up system integrated into the login screen.
Navigate to the running application in your browser.
Click the "Sign Up" tab.
Enter your desired username and password.
Click the "Sign Up" button.
Your account will be created in a local user_database.json file, and you will be logged in automatically. For future sessions, you can use the "Login" tab.
